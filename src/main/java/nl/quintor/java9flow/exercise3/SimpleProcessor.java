 * Exercise 3
 *
 * Implement a synchronous {@link Flow.Processor} that:
 *      Receives integers from a {@link Flow.Publisher}.
 *      Transforms the integers to strings.
 *      Publishes the strings to a subscriber (or multiple subscribers if you think it is too easy).
 *
 * You will have to create your own implementation of {@link Flow.Subscription} as well.
